import sys

sys.argv: This is an array of every argument that is being put into the shell, spliced by spaces.
  Example: (IN SHELL) ServiceBroker.py Error 404
    argv[0] = ServiceBroker.py
    argv[1] = Error
    argv[2] = 404

In this program, we are using sys.argv to determine what each program will do when given the required arguments in the proper format.
