#sb = subprocess.run(args, shell = True, stdout = subprocess.PIPE)

The line of code above is used by every task besides the text broker, as the text broker is the last task that is to be called in every case.

subprocess.run in this case takes in 3 parameters:
  1.) args: this is the path of an executable file to run, followed by any arguments that are defined in that executable's parameters
  2.) shell = True: This just ensures that the subprocess is being ran through the shell
  3.) stdout = subprocess.PIPE: This makes the output of the current running executable file the output of the executable file that runs as a subprocess. 
      In this case, it is building a stack of stdouts of each program that is called as a subprocess that will all eventually be returned
